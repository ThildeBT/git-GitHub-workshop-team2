Plenty of steps!
Make the Crust:
	Combine Flour and Salt: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.
	Cut in Butter: Add the cold, diced butter to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
	Add Ice Water: Gradually add the ice water, a tablespoon at a time, mixing with a fork until the dough comes together. Be careful not to add too much water.
	Form Dough: Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Prepare the Filling:
	Peel and Slice Apples: Peel, core, and slice the apples thinly.
	Mix Filling: In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice (if using). Toss to coat the apples evenly.
Assemble the Pie:
	Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
	Roll Out Dough: On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disk of dough to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place the rolled dough into the pie plate.
	Add Filling: Pour the apple filling into the crust, mounding it slightly in the center.
	Top Crust: Roll out the second disk of dough and place it over the filling. Trim the excess dough, leaving about 1/2 inch overhang. Fold the overhang under itself and crimp the edges to seal.
	Cut Slits: Cut a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.
Egg Wash:
	Prepare Egg Wash: In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon of water.
	Brush Crust: Brush the top crust with the egg wash.
Bake the Pie:
	Bake: Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake in the preheated oven for 45-55 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
	Cool: Let the pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before serving. This allows the filling to set.
