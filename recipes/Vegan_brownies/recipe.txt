Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking dish or line it with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt until well combined.

Add the vegetable oil, plant-based milk, and vanilla extract. Stir until smooth. The batter will be thick, but make sure there are no dry pockets.

If using, fold in the dairy-free chocolate chips.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly.

Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the top looks set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean with a few moist crumbs.

Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares. This helps them set and become fudgier.

Serve and enjoy! These brownies pair wonderfully with a glass of cold plant-based milk or a scoop of vegan ice cream.
